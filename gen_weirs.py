# v04: Add code to process water control structures.
# v03: use linear_features-v02.shp, to bring in some manual features,
#      mostly these are the features we want, although gate-like features
#      are also in here.
# v02: pull max elevation within 5m -- at some places the levee line does not
# quite follow the crest of the levee.  
# v01: separate out by 'Class'
